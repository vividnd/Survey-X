### Version Management

**Arcium uses `arcup` version manager** which ensures:
- **MAJOR.MINOR versions are always in sync** across all Arcium components
- **PATCH versions can differ** (non-breaking changes)
- **Automatic compatibility** between CLI, Arx Node, and other components

**Available Arcium versions:**
- ✅ 0.2.0 (current, latest)
- ✅ 0.1.47 (installed, older)

### Installation Method Used

- **Arcium**: Installed via official installation script, now managed by `arcup`
- **Rust**: Updated via `rustup update` and set to stable toolchain
- **Solana CLI (Agave)**: Now uses Agave installer (client renamed from Solana to Agave): `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/v2.1.6/install)"`
- **Anchor**: Updated via `avm` (Anchor Version Manager) to latest 0.31.1

### Environment Setup

Created `setup-env.sh` script that:
- Sets correct PATH order for all dependencies
- Verifies all tools are accessible
- Can be sourced in new terminals: `source setup-env.sh`

### Verification

All dependencies have been verified to work correctly:
- ✅ Arcium CLI 0.2.0 responds to commands
- ✅ Project initialization works
- ✅ Rust compilation works
- ✅ Solana CLI commands execute properly
- ✅ Anchor framework is functional
- ✅ Docker containers can be managed
- ✅ Yarn package management works

## 🚀 Ready for Arcium Development

The development environment is now properly configured with:
- **Arcium 0.2.0** (latest version managed by arcup)
- All dependencies at their latest compatible versions
- Proper version management ensuring component compatibility

You can proceed with:
1. Initializing new Arcium projects
2. Building confidential instructions
3. Running local networks
4. Deploying MXE programs

## 📝 Usage

To use this environment in any new terminal session:
```bash
source setup-env.sh
```

To manage Arcium versions:
```bash
arcup list          # List installed versions
arcup use <version> # Switch to specific version
arcup version       # Show current version
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Solana CLI → Agave Installer
**The Solana CLI installer has been renamed to Agave installer** due to client changes. Use the new installer command:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/v2.1.6/install)"
```

### Version Compatibility
**Version compatibility is managed by arcup** - you don't need to worry about manually matching versions between Arcium components. The version manager ensures that CLI, Arx Node, and other components are always compatible.
